Clone the develop branch.

Run npm install, and make sure that you are using Node version 18.4.0.

This app uses CORS with node and express, so you need to start the proxy-server in order to access the data. To do this, open a new terminal
in the root of the techniacal-test-zara project and type: cd cors-server and use comand node app.

To run the project in your VSC, open a terminal and type npm run dev. Remember that the previous terminal with the 
proxy server needs to be running as well.

On the first page a total of 100 podcasts will appear and we will have a search engine that will filter in real time what you are typing to show you the result of what it finds in this search.

When we click on a podcast it will take us to the next page that will show us related information about the podcast and the episodes it has.

We will be able to click on the episodes so that this will take us to its page where we will be able to listen to the episode and read its information.
